In a nutshell:
- This is part of a coding study, and NOT for commercial use.
- It's a solo work.
- Tech stack is MERN.
- The web app (studentDB) allows educational insitutions to manage their student records online.
- It has all the CRUD operations & authentication setups.
- You can checkout the deployed website here: [studentDB.online](https://studentdb.online).

It was great fun and a massive learning curve to make/design the app.
